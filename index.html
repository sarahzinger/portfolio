		<div class="title"> I love to create things, build communities, and solve problems </div>
		<p> I've worked as a social worker, community organizer, and most recently as Executive Director of a new tech nonprofit called Americans Give. I am fascinated by the use of technology for social good and am an aspiring web developer.</p>
		<p> I studied Sociology and Women's Studies at <a href="http://www.vassar.edu/">Vassar College</a>, where I worked at the <a href="http://womenscenter.vassar.edu/">Women's Center</a> and first took a computer science class. While at Vassar, I found I was passionate about student activism and went on to get my <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/"> Master in Social Work with a focus on Community Organizing, Planning and Development at Hunter College</a>. In my studies, I interned with <a href="http://www.naminycmetro.org/">NAMI NYC Metro</a> and <a href="http://www.hudsonlink.org/">Hudson Link</a>. </p>
		<p> After graduating, I worked for two years as a social worker in Brooklyn and Queens. Through this work I learned invaluable lessons about myself and the world around me. I left with a conviction to find innovative ways to improve access to vital funding and technology for nonprofits, which led me to my current role as Executive Director of Americans Give, a new small tech-focused nonprofit, which seeks to reinvision how Americans donate to campaigns and causes. 

		<p> In my free time I love to cook, write, and code. For a copy of my resume feel free to email me <a href="mailto:sarah.muenzinger@gmail.com">here</a>. For a glimpse at some of my recent projects, check out my portfolio below.</p>
